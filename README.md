Copyright status
Some controversy exists around the copyright status of the deck.[20] Under UK copyright law, works fall into the public domain 70 years after the death of the author,[21] which may refer to either Waite (1942) or Smith (1951). Australian copyright law currently has the same term under a 2004 amendment; however, unlike in the UK's 1995 amendment, this law was not retroactive, and the deck therefore passed into the public domain 50 years after the author's death. In the United States, the deck fell into the public domain in 1966 (publication + 28 years + renewed 28 years), and thus has been available for use by American artists in numerous different media projects. U.S. Games Systems has previously claimed[22] that copyright over the deck expires in 2021, 70 years after the death of the author, in accordance with the 1998 Copyright Term Extension Act (which does not apply to works published prior to 1923). This claim has yet to be tested in a court of law.
